### Origin Story
With the birth of the Singularity, mankind transcends death and fragility. With a righteous cybernetic army, Jesse and his Cybernauts embark on holy cybernetic warfare to stamp out the vestiges of human mortality; the irrational, intentionally unevolved, and their supers.

#### Gameplay

Jesse and the Cybernauts is a gamblefi game where players pay a tiny fee in $jesse token for a chance to win the pool's prize pot. Each time a player plays, the pool's prize pot grows.

In addition to the chance to win the prize pot, players also earn other tokens from the game's meme distribution engine. These tokens are recognized by the game and supply each player with tokens to further incentivize playing.

Even the $jesse token is shared to players as part of the game's token distribution. This token is also used to pay the fee for each play.

The game's profits are used to boost the value of these tokens provided to players as yield. With each play, players who own the game's related CYBERNAUT NFT play at a discount and earn massive discounts to their winnings in the game.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
